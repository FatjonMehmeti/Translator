The app is a simple translation app developed through HTML, JavaScript and CSS
It uses a simple CSS and HTML interface, that uses much of the default look
of many translation services. As it pertains to the knowledge garnered in our course
since the spell checker app I committed for the miniproject last term would include
most concepts that we looked at the first term of the semester, I included here most
concepts we looked at the second term of the semester. The concepts used in this project
are:
-DBMS (database management systems)
	-Though since setting up XAMPP in a school environment proves to be difficult I have used
	the mymemory translated API to do most of the database. This API does the database functions
	automatically, but I will explain what it does practically and theoretically in my project
	presentation.
-Functional Programming
	-Since JS is a highly functional programming oriented language, I have used a lot of functional
	programming, which as I go over the code in the presentation, I will explain more or less what 
	each function does
-Web Application
	-The program is made exclusively through JS, HTML and CSS. It is in essence a pure webapp.
-GUI
	-The program is a simple and intuitive GUI ran on JS. The GUI is written on HTML and CSS.
